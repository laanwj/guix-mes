     glibc still has a custom restorer because they want to be able to
     backtrace.  gdb has a second part that detects a specific instruction
     sequence and then fixes up the backtrace.  Since we don't use that
     specific instruction sequence and also the non-siginfo restorer
     is complicated (pops foreign item off the stack--so needs inline
     assembly) and we don't support great debuggability in other places,
     I've decided to take the easy way out for now. */
